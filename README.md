# Zaidaan Shibuya — Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site 👋  
I’m a computer science student and builder who loves combining software, data, and real-world businesses — from restaurant tech and property management tools to fintech and quantitative finance experiments.

This site lives here on GitHub Pages and serves as a central hub for my projects, skills, and experience.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m **Zaidaan Shibuya**, a computer science student with a strong interest in:

- Building real products that people actually use

- Full-stack development (from frontend UX to backend APIs and data)

I like working on projects that have both **technical depth** and **business impact** — things like automation tools for small businesses, analytics dashboards, and finance-related applications.
